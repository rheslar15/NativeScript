The HTTP module provides a functionality, which allows submitting GET and POST requests for both platforms (iOS and Android).
With its methods, we could request a data from a remote server and to represent the received response in different formats. We could request or send data with the following ways:

* `getString`
* `getJSON`
* `getImage`
* `getFile`
* `request`
