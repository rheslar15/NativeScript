Use the [`showModal`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_layouts_grid_layout_.gridlayout#showmodal) method of the `View` class to show another view as a modal dialog. You must specify the location of the modal page module. You can provide a context and a callback function that will be called when the modal view is closed. You can also optionally specify whether to show the modal view in fullscreen or not. To close the modal view, you need to subscribe to its [`shownModally`](https://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_layouts_grid_layout_.gridlayout#shownmodallyevent) event and store a reference to a close callback function provided by the event arguments. Call this function when you are ready to close the modal view, optionally passing some results to the master page. Here is an example with two views &mdash; the main view and a login view. The main one shows the login view modally; the user enters their username and password and when ready clicks the Login button. This closes the modal login view and returns the username/password to the main page which can then log the user in.

> **TIP:** By design on iPhone, a modal view appears only in fullscreen.
