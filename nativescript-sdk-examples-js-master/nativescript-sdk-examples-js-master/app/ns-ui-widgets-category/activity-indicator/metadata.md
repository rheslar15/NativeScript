description: ActivityIndicator is an abstraction over Android's ProgressBar and iOS's UActivityIndicatorView.  This UI component is used for displaying the progress while running background operations (e.g loading image, data, accepting a request). The ActivityIndicator's value could be controlled via its `busy` property.
