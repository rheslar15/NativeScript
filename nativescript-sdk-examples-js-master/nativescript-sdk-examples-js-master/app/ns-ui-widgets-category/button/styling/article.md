To style and customize the `Button` widget use the conventional CSS properties and Icon Fonts.
The widget also supports the CSS pseudo-selector `active` which will be triggered when the button is pressed.
The example below shows a button with icon (using icon font), several CSS properties and with an `active` state styling.
