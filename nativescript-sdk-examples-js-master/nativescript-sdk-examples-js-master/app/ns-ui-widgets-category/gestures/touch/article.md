Action: A finger action was performed.

This is a general purpose gesture that is triggered whenever a pointer (usually a finger)
 has performed a touch action (up, down, move or cancel). 
 `TouchGestureEventData` provides information about all the pointers currently on the screen and their position inside the view that triggered the event.
