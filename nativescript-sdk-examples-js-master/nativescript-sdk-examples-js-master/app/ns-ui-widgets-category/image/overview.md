The `Image` widget shows an image in your mobile application. 
In a NativeScript application images are added to an application either declaratively (XML) or with code. We can load the image from an `ImageSource` or a URL using the `src` property.
Behind the `Image` module stands `UIImage` on iOS and `android.widget.ImageView` on Android.
As working with images is an essential part of each mobile application following [the best practices](https://docs.nativescript.org/best-practices/images-optimisations) is a must.

> **Note:** NativeScript supports images encoded as `PNG` or `JPG` files.
